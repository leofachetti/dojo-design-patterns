# Design Patterns 

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

## Creational Patterns

These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

* [Singleton](/singleton/README.md)
* [Abstract Factory](/abstractfactory/README.md)

## Structural Patterns

These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

* [Decorator](/decorator/README.md)
* [Facade](/facade/README.md)
* [Protection Proxy](/protectionproxy//README.md)
* [Composite](/composite/README.md)

## Structural Patterns

These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.

* [Command](/command/README.md)
* [State](/state/README.md)
